# Changelog

All notable changes to GigaClaw.

## Unreleased

### Added

- **Local Media Creation team** with dedicated direction, ComfyUI image, ComfyUI/Phosphene motion,
  OpenMontage composition, and independent review agents.
- **Durable governed media jobs** with per-project SQLite state, idempotent submission, provider
  resource locks, cancellation, timeout, restart interruption recovery, provenance receipts, REST
  endpoints, and board-state reconciliation.
- **OpenMontage execution gates** that require explicit providers, approved Layer 3 skills, locked
  output roots, and completed human-approved project/pipeline checkpoints for clip generation.

## [v0.10] — 2026-07-24

Scheduled tickets, per-ticket token cost, a rebuilt cron scheduler — and a deep security & reliability hardening pass.

### Highlights

Tickets can now be **scheduled**: park a ticket in the new "Scheduled" column with a fire date and a target column, and a background service auto-promotes it once due — calendar-dated work gets a dedicated home instead of polluting "Blocked". The schedule is visible and editable directly in the ticket panel, and scheduled cards show a countdown badge on the board.

Agent runs now report **what they cost**: token usage and USD cost are captured from the CLI, accumulated per run, and persisted as durable per-ticket totals — with badges on board cards, the ticket panel, and the run drawer, which also makes the daily budget gate real.

Interval/cron triggers were rebuilt around a **persisted NextRunAt schedule**: a restart that straddles the scheduled moment still fires on time, a missed occurrence catches up with one immediate fire, external edits to `automations.json` are picked up automatically, and raw cron text entry is replaced with a day/time picker. A **concurrency-lock dead man's switch** force-stops hung runs that would otherwise hold their group's lock forever, with a new endpoint listing currently-locked groups.

This release also lands a broad hardening pass: stored XSS in markdown rendering, path traversal in dashboard tiles and project/agent slugs, and unsafe image uploads are all fixed, two vulnerable transitive dependencies are pinned, and a series of concurrency defects (lost session-registry writes, a dashboard tile gate permit leak, engine-tick starvation, deadlock-prone subprocess runners) are resolved.

### Added

- **Scheduled tickets** (feature #99): "Scheduled" status/column with `FireAt` + target column, 30s auto-promotion service, `PATCH …/tickets/{id}/schedule` endpoint, countdown badge and soonest-first sort on the board.
- **Ticket panel schedule editor**: view/edit the schedule in local time, "Schedule…" button on non-scheduled tickets; moving a ticket out of Scheduled clears its schedule.
- **Per-ticket token cost**: usage and `total_cost_usd` captured from CLI result events, per-run accumulation, durable per-ticket totals and workspace cost-log; badges on board card, ticket panel, and run drawer; runs API exposes token fields.
- **Concurrency-lock dead man's switch** (ticket #98): opt-in per-automation inactivity timeout (`LockTimeoutMinutes`), per-run activity heartbeat, a reaper that force-stops idle runs, and `GET /projects/{slug}/concurrency-groups` for lock observability.
- **Anonymous daily usage heartbeat** to Umami Cloud: one event per instance per 24h (instance GUID, version, OS family), silent-fail, disabled in Development.
- **Isolated debug instance**: `gigaclaw-web-debug` launch config on :5232 with its own data dir and a mock claude CLI, so end-to-end verification never touches real projects.
- **CI**: GitHub Actions build + test workflow on every push/PR to main/dev, with the mock claude built explicitly for hermetic integration tests.
- **Memory index links**: agent `MEMORY.md` index lines are now markdown links to their topic files; the consolidation pass rewrites legacy lines on touch.

### Changed

- **Interval/cron triggers reworked** around a persisted `NextRunAt`: cron-only schedule computed at registration, restart-safe firing, one-shot catch-up of missed occurrences, automatic reload when `automations.json` changes on disk, day/time picker instead of raw cron text (legacy `Seconds` migrated to cron).
- **Dashboard tile registration is no longer required**: tiles appear as soon as their `.dashboard/<slug>/` folder exists; layout rows are created lazily on first move/resize.
- **MaxRunDuration contract honored**: chat sessions are no longer force-killed at 60 min; automation runs and memory consolidation get 30 min, dashboard tile refreshes 15 min, and `null` genuinely means no wall-clock timeout.
- **Column sort by due date replaced with modified date** — the due-date sort was a no-op (tickets have no due-date field); persisted sort preferences remain valid.

### Fixed

- **Duplicate board columns crashed the board**: self-healing dedupe migration, UNIQUE index on column names, idempotent column creation, rename-onto-taken-name refused, and the board now degrades instead of crashing on corrupted data.
- **SessionRegistry lost concurrent writes**: read-modify-write cycles are now atomic under the file lock, ending lost session IDs and regressed commit cursors.
- **DashboardTileGate permit leak**: a cancelled refresh winner permanently blocked all subsequent tile refreshes across all projects.
- **Engine tick starvation**: long inline automation actions (memory consolidation, PowerShell) detach to a background task instead of blocking every trigger in every project.
- **Ad-hoc subprocess runners consolidated** onto a hardened `ProcessRunner`: concurrent pipe drain (no more deadlocks), enforced wall-clock timeouts, process-tree kill, and a per-repository git semaphore so one slow repo no longer stalls all memory commits.
- **Multi-statement writes wrapped in transactions**: no more orphaned tickets after a crash mid column-rename/delete or member delete.
- **Migration overhead**: inline migrations now run once per database file instead of on every query, with new indexes on the board's hot paths; ALTER TABLE errors are no longer silently swallowed.
- **AgentRunDrawer** no longer kills the Blazor circuit with "Collection was modified" — event-buffer mutation moved onto the sync context.
- **Localization** falls back to English when a key is missing from the active language, and formats invariantly.
- **Test suite unhung**: steering tests no longer respawn mock subprocesses forever; full suite 472/472 in 17s.

### Security

- **Stored XSS**: all Markdig pipelines now `DisableHtml()`, and tile style attributes only accept validated CSS colors.
- **Path traversal** blocked on dashboard tile delete/move/resize/refresh (the delete sink validates the resolved path as defense in depth), and project/agent slugs are validated before touching the filesystem.
- **Image upload hardened**: real format sniffed from magic bytes (png/jpg/gif/webp only, no SVG), 10 MB cap, nosniff + sandboxing CSP on `/uploads/` responses.
- **Dependency pins**: SQLitePCLRaw 3.0.3 (CVE-2025-6965) and Microsoft.OpenApi 2.10.0 (GHSA-v5pm-xwqc-g5wc).

## [v0.9] — 2026-07-02

Ollama local model support, per-action model selection, and a centralized model catalog.

### Highlights

This release brings first-class local-model support: Ollama models are now selectable per-action and per-member through an OpenAI-compatible provider, with a model discovery endpoint and dedicated selectors in the chat drawer and member settings. Claude model support is centralized in a new `ClaudeModelCatalog`, which now also lists Fable 5 and Sonnet 5.

Reliability also improves: background agent runs get a longer default timeout, empty model selections no longer leak through as invalid state, and the `--disallowed-tools Memory` flag is no longer sent where it's a no-op or unsupported (Ollama models).

### Added
- **Ollama local model support** via an OpenAI-compatible provider, with a model discovery endpoint (`SaveLocalModelConfig`) and per-action / per-member model selectors.
- **`Member.DefaultModel`** with runtime model resolution used across chat and actions.
- **`ClaudeModelCatalog`**: centralizes the supported Claude model list; adds `claude-fable-5` and `claude-sonnet-5`.
- **Chat drawer model selector** (New Instruction), theme-consistent with the rest of the UI.
- **Streamed loading bubble**: `content_block_delta` text now streams directly into the chat drawer's loading bubble.
- **SSE error/stderr surfacing** in the chat drawer, with a forced new session on model change.
- **Kanban column pagination**: sorted columns load 20 tickets initially, 10 more per load-more.

### Changed
- Removed the "(default)" model option; unset selections fall back to `claude-sonnet-4-6`.
- Default background run timeout bumped from 30 to 60 minutes.
- Chat drawer stderr events are muted from the visible log; connectors warning suppressed.

### Fixed
- Empty model string now normalizes to `null` in `ActionExecutor` instead of leaking through as an invalid value.
- `--disallowed-tools Memory` dropped as a no-op flag, and skipped entirely for Ollama models.

## [v0.8] — 2026-06-16

Escape-key coverage, scroll preservation, real AskUserQuestion schema, and a much tighter agent process lifecycle.

### Highlights

This release finishes the Escape-key story started in v0.7: fullscreen editors now share a native confirm modal with dirty-check, the URL-loaded ticket panel is properly wired into the Escape stack, and handlers are re-registered after cancel so the second press still works.

The AskUserQuestion chat widget moves from prototype to production: it consumes the real CLI schema (`questions[].options[].label`), exposes an `IsAwaitingUserAnswer` flag, has a steering timeout, and a long-standing `SteeringQueue` race that swallowed mid-turn answers is fixed. The widget now renders with proper CSS variables instead of stray hex colors.

Agent process lifecycle gets two important fixes: claude subprocess trees are confined to a Win32 **job object** so a run can never leak children, and a force-kill kicks in after the `result` event if the process refuses to exit — no more hangs holding workspaces hostage. Chained `runAgent` actions (notably the judge) are now correctly dispatched in post-run processing.

The board preserves column scroll position on ticket open/close, the project delete control is relocated from the home card to a proper **danger zone** in ProjectSettings, and agent memory adopts a per-topic index layout (with the legacy `memory.md` still injected during the migration window).

### Added
- **Claude Opus 4.8** and **4.8-1M** model support across ActionEditor, Dashboard, and ProjectSettings.
- **Real AskUserQuestion CLI schema**: `questions[].options[].label` with `question`/`choices` aliases.
- **`IsAwaitingUserAnswer` flag** + steering timeout for AskUserQuestion turns.
- **Column scroll preservation** on ticket open/close via `board.js`.
- **Danger zone** in ProjectSettings: delete relocated from the home card.
- **Adversarial testing step** in the qa-tester skill.
- **Per-topic memory index**: `memory/MEMORY.md` scored index + on-demand topic files; native auto-memory disabled for agents.
- **README Dashboard section** with tile catalog and screenshot.

### Changed
- **EscapeKeyStack** wired into fullscreen editors (push in `OpenFullscreen` with dirty-check, dispose in Cancel/Save) and into the URL-loaded ticket panel.
- **Fullscreen ESC** uses an integrated native Blazor confirm modal; handler re-registered after cancel.

### Fixed
- **SteeringQueue race** that dropped mid-turn answers to AskUserQuestion.
- **AskUserQuestion widget**: submit button restored, CSS variables instead of hex colors.
- **Claude subprocess tree confined to a Win32 job object** so runs never leak children or hang the workspace.
- **Force-kill claude** after its `result` event when the process refuses to exit.
- **Chained `runAgent`** (judge) correctly dispatched in post-run action processing.
- **Legacy `memory.md` still injected** when present, to avoid recall loss mid-migration.
- **`board.js` loaded** so the column scroll-save JS interop resolves.

## [v0.7] — 2026-05-26

Agentic chat polish, dashboard reliability, and tag-based versioning.

### Highlights

This release turns the chat drawer into a real conversational surface: you can now steer agents mid-thinking, answer their questions as interactive bubbles, paste images, and resume runs that hit the max-turns ceiling — with messages that never silently drop on the floor.

The dashboard side becomes durable: tile refreshes and trigger runs persist their last-run timestamp and catch up after a restart, paused projects no longer waste cycles, and a friendly frequency picker covers the common "every N minutes / daily at HH:MM" cases.

Under the hood, versioning now flows from git tags via MinVer — which is exactly what made this release possible without touching a single csproj — and the automation engine has been split into a `TriggerHandler` + `RunStateManager` pair for easier reasoning.

Escape-key handling makes progress: the label and member managers now close on Escape with focus restored, and the legacy label/member buttons have been removed from the Board view. Several popups (ticket edition, title/description editors, tile add and edit, run history after navigating into an agent) still need wiring — expect more coverage in the next release.

### Added
- **Real-time steering**: inject text mid-thinking; messages dropped mid-turn are auto-replayed on the next turn.
- **AskUserQuestion bubbles** rendered as interactive prompts in the chat drawer.
- **Continue banner** when an agent hits max-turns, with one-click resume.
- **Image paste support** in the chat drawer.
- **Per-ticket worktrees**: helper scripts and a `{ticketId}` placeholder in `concurrencyGroup`, `mutuallyExclusiveWith`, and PowerShell args.
- **Per-ticket chain serialization** with debounce-on-completion to avoid duplicate runs.
- **Retry button** on the agent run drawer for failed runs.
- **Quota fallback model** triggered on rate-limit and usage-limit events.
- **Persist dashboard tile state**: `LastRefreshedAt` per tile with startup catch-up; same for interval/cron triggers via `LastRunAt`.
- **Pause-aware refresh**: skip dashboard tile refresh for paused projects.
- **Friendly frequency picker** for dashboard tiles, with daily-at scheduling.
- **Heatmap tile** enhanced with per-color intensity and an optional legend.
- **Escape key stack** broadened across popups (label/member managers included), with focus restoration.
- **Bidirectional column sort** via right-click context menu.
- **Agent running indicator** on project cards.
- **Release-update banner** with version compare and a dev simulate endpoint.
- **Markdown fallback** for deep content in chat; shared markdown pipeline now renders comment line breaks.
- `GIGACLAW_TICKET_ID` env var exposed to agent subprocesses.

### Changed
- **Versioning via MinVer**: assembly version is derived from the latest `vX.Y.Z` git tag — no more manual csproj edits.
- **Endpoints split** into per-domain `Endpoints.*.cs` partial files.
- **AutomationEngine refactor**: extracted `TriggerHandler` and `RunStateManager`.
- **Member DELETE** cascade-clears assignments and protects the owner with HTTP 409.
- **OpenAPI**: typed response schemas, `Produces`/`ProducesProblem` annotations, `TicketSummary` vs `Ticket` distinction.
- **Legacy label/member management** buttons and popups removed from the Board view.
- **BoardFilterState** registered as scoped to isolate filter state per browser tab.

### Fixed
- `MainLayout` set to `InteractiveServer` rendermode to avoid a Body serialization crash.
- `FlattenJson` falls back to raw JSON when no body is extractable.
- `ReorderTicketAsync` now raises `TicketStatusChanged` when a column changes.
- `ticketInColumn` trigger now fires on unassigned tickets.
- `commitAsync` deferred until successful run completion to avoid partial commits on failure.
- Drop `--remote-control` and close stdin so claude runs don't deadlock; skipped entirely for chat sessions to prevent `payload.json` IPC conflict.
- `commitAgentMemory` uses the nested `.agents` git repo when present.
- PowerShell 5.1 fallback when `pwsh` is absent on Windows.
- Auto-continue chat run when steering messages are dropped mid-turn.

## [v0.6] — 2026-05-15

Dashboard tile pipeline overhaul, agent run robustness, and UX polish.

### Added
- **Script-first content pipeline** for dashboard tiles: tiles run a script that emits content, with UTF-8 stdout/stderr.
- **Folder-per-tile layout** with convention-based filenames under `.dashboard/`.
- **Global dashboard tile refresh semaphore** (size 1, LRU) to serialize refreshes and avoid concurrent claude sessions.
- Confirmation dialog before deleting an automation.
- `DashboardTileGate` documented in dashboard architecture docs.

### Changed
- `tile-chat` assistant raised to MaxTurns=25 and allowed to read existing files; now generates real `scriptContent` instead of a stub.
- README video replaced with YouTube thumbnail + animated WebP so it works in private browsing and across devices.

### Fixed
- Label remove button now visible on hover and no longer triggers ticket card click (#199).
- Prevent orphaned `Running` agent runs when `ClaudeRunner` pumps throw (#188).
- Dashboard tile refresh forces a fresh claude session each time so tools re-run instead of replaying.
- `TileSidecar.Prompt` and `Model` marked optional in the OpenAPI spec.

### Fixed
- Mermaid tile SVG fills its tile and scales with resize.
- Outside-click no longer dismisses edit modals.
- Snapshot `_events` list before iteration in `AgentRunDrawer`.
- Web host URL fallback propagation (HTTP-only on :5000 when unconfigured; `--urls` CLI arg honored; HTTPS redirection/HSTS removed).
