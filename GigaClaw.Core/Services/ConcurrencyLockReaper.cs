/// Dead man's switch for concurrency-group locks (ticket #98, feature #3).
///
/// A RunAgent automation's concurrency group is "locked" for as long as a run in that group is
/// <see cref="AgentRunStatus.Running"/>. The nominal end paths and the <c>finally</c> safety net in
/// <see cref="ClaudeRunner"/> release the lock on any managed exit. But a pure hang — a claude
/// subprocess stuck on a network call that never returns and never throws — leaves the run Running
/// forever, so every later dispatch in that group is skipped silently until GigaClaw restarts.
///
/// This background service periodically scans all active runs and, for those whose automation set a
/// <see cref="AgentRun.LockTimeoutMinutes"/>, force-stops any run that has emitted no activity (no
/// StreamEvent) for longer than that timeout — cancelling it to kill the subprocess tree and
/// completing it as <see cref="AgentRunStatus.Stopped"/> so the lock is released immediately.
/// </summary>
