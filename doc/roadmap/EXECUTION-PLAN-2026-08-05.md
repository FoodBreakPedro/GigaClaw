# Incremental execution plan - 2026-08-05

This ledger keeps the remaining GigaClaw work recoverable across sessions and usage limits. Update it after every implementation checkpoint. Each checkpoint should produce a focused implementation commit followed by a status/evidence commit when documentation changes are needed.

## Working rules

- Work only in GigaClaw. Do not access or edit ZabalaZone or zabs-server.
- Preserve `.obsidian/**`, `graphify-out/**`, and unrelated owner changes unless explicitly included in a named checkpoint.
- Give sub-agents disjoint file ownership and record their model, scope, and result below.
- Run focused tests before each implementation commit and the full affected suites before merging.
- Record the commit id, tests, propagation files, remaining risks, and exact next action before starting the next checkpoint.
- Merge completed checkpoints early. Do not merge a checkpoint that leaves its user-visible path knowingly broken.

## Checkpoints

| Checkpoint | Scope | Status | Durable result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Stabilize and preserve the existing R8 Codex harness | Complete | `ecba804`, `8de75ca`; evidence commit follows this ledger update |
| 1 | CMS `categorySlug` and `tags` dispatch, authentication, and placeholder safety | Next | - |
| 2 | Non-destructive `.agents` synchronization with dry-run drift reporting | Pending | - |
| 3 | Deliverable catalog, ticket persistence, and deterministic entry routing | Pending | - |
| 4 | Deliverable-first ticket creation and human-readable pipeline progress | Pending | - |
| 5 | Canonical content routes and bounded translator/content recovery | Pending | - |
| 6 | End-to-end journey, propagation report, and deployment handoff | Pending | - |
| 7 | Security join, Codex budgets, model overrides, and specialist promotion | Pending | - |

## Checkpoint 0 log

Branch: `codex/r8-codex-harness`

Existing R8 work was moved off `main` without changing the working tree. Obsidian and Graphify files remain unstaged and excluded.

Verification completed:

- Initial focused R8 suite: 19 passed.
- Initial full solution gate: 1,473 Core tests and 45 Eval tests passed.
- Initial opt-in live test exposed that it was invoking `GigaClaw.CodexMock` instead of the real CLI.
- Corrected opt-in real Codex test: 1 passed against the authenticated CLI.
- Final focused runtime, lifecycle, policy, routing, and member gate: 69 passed.
- Final full solution gate: 1,484 Core tests and 45 Eval tests passed.
- Implementation commits: `ecba804` and `8de75ca`.

Review and implementation assignments:

| Model | Scope | Result |
|---|---|---|
| GPT-5.4 | R8 file/test inventory | Found model-picker inconsistency, mock fail-open risk, and router coverage gap |
| GPT-5.5 | Runtime architecture review | Found missing terminal-event exit grace and silent invalid-model fallback |
| Luna | Documentation/evidence audit | Found stale roadmap statements and required durable handoff files |
| Terra | Commit-boundary review | Recommended separate vertical implementation and evidence commits |
| GPT-5.5 | Terminal-event grace and per-instance binary resolution patch | Implemented, reviewed, and integrated |
| Terra | Fail-closed model patch | Identified required runner integration; no files changed due ownership boundary |

Deferred test improvement: direct `AgentRunnerRouter.RunAsync` precedence coverage remains useful, but environment parsing, member persistence, mock dispatch, and live dispatch are covered and the gap is not release-blocking.

Exact next action: begin checkpoint 1 with focused `DraftFrontmatter` parsing/emission tests, then complete the CMS body-template path and blog-writer contract.

## Propagation and deployment

Checkpoint 0 does not modify `ProjectTemplate/Agents/**`, so it has no `.agents` propagation list. Any later checkpoint that changes embedded templates must regenerate the core manifest, list only intentional hash changes, and provide the exact existing-project propagation set.

The owner must rebuild and redeploy `GigaClaw.Core.dll` on zabs-server after embedded-template changes. Server access remains outside this work.

## Graphify decision

`graphify-out/` is ignored while existing generated files remain tracked. Do not untrack or delete them as part of these checkpoints. Any index cleanup requires separate owner approval.
